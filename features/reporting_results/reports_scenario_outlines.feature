Feature: Reports scenario outlines

  In order to see how Serenity/JS reports Cucumber scenario outlines
  As a curious developer
  I'd like to see an example implementation

  Scenario Outline: People who make Serenity happen

  Here's an example of a scenario outline.
  Outlines are useful when you need to run the exact same scenario multiple times
  for different inputs and/or expected outputs.

    When <Developer> makes a contribution of:
      | value      |
      | time       |
      | talent     |
      | great code |
    Then they help bring serenity to fellow devs
