Reporting special step arguments

Narrative:
In order to quickly learn how to use Serenity/JS with Cucumber
As a busy developer
I'd like to see examples demonstrating how Serenity/JS reports special step arguments

Cucumber supports "special step arguments", such as [DocStrings](https://relishapp.com/cucumber/cucumber/docs/gherkin/doc-strings)
and [Data Tables](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/docs/support_files/data_table_interface.md).
Serenity/JS can report them too.
